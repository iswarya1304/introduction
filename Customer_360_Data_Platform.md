In my current role, I am responsible for the maintenance, monitoring, and optimization of Azure-based data engineering solutions to ensure seamless pipeline operations. 
I manage Azure Data Factory pipelines that handle data ingestion and transformation, resolving issues proactively to maintain data accuracy and minimize downtime.
The data I work with includes both structured formats from on-premise Oracle and SQL Server databases and unstructured formats. I automated routine monitoring tasks 
using PowerShell scripts, enabling automatic status checks and restarting failed jobs, which significantly reduced manual intervention.
To ensure system reliability, I set up real-time alerts and dashboards in Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, providing proactive notifications to stakeholders 
about pipeline health and system anomalies. I also troubleshoot escalated issues, such as pipeline failures and data mismatches, resolving them within strict SLAs.
Collaboration with development and infrastructure teams has been a key aspect of my work, enabling the deployment of updates and fixes to improve pipeline efficiency.
Additionally, I document all processes, troubleshooting steps, and resolutions to build a centralized knowledge base for future reference and team training.
This role has strengthened my ability to ensure robust data operations while minimizing risks and maximizing efficiency.
