I am a Data Engineer with 3 years of experience in designing and maintaining robust pipelines with technologies like Databricks, 
Azure Data Factory, ADLS Blob Storage, PySpark, SQL, and Python. I have implemented efficient data processing workflows in PySpark
within Databricks, leveraging ADLS Blob Storage to handle large-scale data efficiently.
In my previous roles I have been responsible for developing and implementing ETL/ELT pipelines using Azure Data Factory,
Azure Databricks, Azure Functions to ingest and transform data from various sources like SQL server, cloud storage etc .
I have also created optimized SQL queries for data extraction and transformation from ADLS blob storage ,ensuring high 
performance for reporting and analytics .
Throughout our projects we have followed Agile methodology where we have used JIRA as a tool to track and manage our projects.
I have collaborated with cross functional teams to implement best practices for data storage and processing in ADLS Blob Storage,
maintaining data quality, accuracy, and consistency across various layers in the architecture.
