My name is Iswarya, and I have 3 years of experience in Azure data engineering. I currently work at Centrepoint Soft Tech Pvt. Ltd., where I specialize in developing end-to-end data engineering pipelines.

I have strong expertise in Python, PySpark, SQL, Azure Database, and Azure Data Factory. My primary responsibilities include designing and implementing data pipelines using Azure Data Factory to move data seamlessly across various locations and destinations.

I am skilled in writing code, performing validations, and creating reusable modules in PySpark and SQL. I also have significant experience with Oracle SQL Server databases, where I handle complex data operations.

In addition to my technical skills, I have worked as both an individual contributor and part of collaborative teams. I am proficient in tools like Jira and GitHub for project and code management.

These experiences and skills have equipped me to deliver scalable, high-quality, and efficient data solutions.
